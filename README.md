## Launch

There are two launch files for this ROS package:  
The first one, `rviz_static.launch`, also launches GUI for joint_state_publisher.  
The other one, `rviz.launch`, requires manual state publishing.  

To run the script for state publishing (`scripts/state_publisher.py`), first launch `rviz.launch`, and then run the script with python3.
